Security & Trust
Blockchain voting ledger: prevents tampering, ensures results are verifiable by anyone.

Multi-factor identity verification: stops fake votes from bots or foreign actors.

Local observer partnerships: Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, citizen journalist networks.

Social Impact Features
“Peace Tracker” — shows how public opinion changes over time as diplomacy happens.

“People’s Proposals” — citizens submit ideas for peace terms before voting.

“Global Solidarity Mode” — outsiders can’t vote, but can pledge humanitarian aid or financial support tied to peace outcomes.

Challenges
Government Resistance — authoritarian regimes may block internet access, punish participation.

Verification in Warzones — must work offline via SMS or in-person via NGOs.

Enforcement — the platform itself can’t force peace; it can only expose the will of the people and create moral/political pressure.

Possible Taglines
“Peace by the People, for the People.”

“No more wars decided without us.”

“Let those who live with the consequences make the choice.”
